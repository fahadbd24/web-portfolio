     <p>Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.</p>

        <h2>Travel when you can</h2>
        <h3 class="violet-highlight">Traveling – it leaves you speechless</h3>
        <p>The gladdest moment in human life, methinks, is a departure into unknown lands.No place is ever as bad as they tell you it’s going to be.Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.</p>
